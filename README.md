~~GitHub: Blame Parent~~
====================

**Good news!** Github's web UI now [comes with this feature](https://github.com/blog/2304-navigate-file-history-faster-with-improved-blame-view)!!!


~~[Get it from the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-blame-parent/kafcedgenijobphganhaeiignhlipdij)~~

~~In the github blame view...~~

~~...hold down the Alt (Option) key...~~

![active](https://raw.github.com/chancancode/blame_parent/master/after.png)

... and click either link to blame either the commit or its parent.  On some operating-system/window-manager/browser combinations, the browser will not register a plain Alt-click - in that case, try Alt-Ctrl-click, which on some browsers will open the blame-enhanced link in a new browser tab.
